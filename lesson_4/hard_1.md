  attr_accessor :hull_count, :propeller_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, fuel_efficiency, fuel_capacity)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers
    @hull_count = num_hulls

    @fuel_capacity = fuel_capacity
  end
end

class Motorboat < Watercraft
  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    super(1, 1, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end
end

class Catamaran < Watercraft
  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    super
  end
end
```

4 add the below method to the Watercraft class
```ruby
def range
  range_by_using_fuel = super
  return range_by_using_fuel + 10
end
```
